    time limit exceed for TC#7 coz fmt.Scanf is too slow ...
    so have to use 
    
    var t, n int
    #1
    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
	scanner.Scan()
    fmt.Sscanf(scanner.Text(), "%d", &n)
    
    #2
    in := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
	fmt.Fscan(in, &t)

    
    maybe this is the better solution to use in the future
